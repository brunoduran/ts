System wide queue
-------------------------
You can set the $USER variable to the same name in all 'ts' processes, and then
they'll use the same socket for intercommunication. This means - single queue.
You should be certain that any 'ts' can read/write to that socket, using
chmod. The current socket naming is:
  /tmp/socket-ts.$USER


Be notified of a task finished
-------------------------
In X windows, inside bash, after submitting the task, I use:
$ ( ts -w ; xmessage Finished! ) &


Add a task to the queue, and receive its output by email (by Raul)
-------------------------
It only works if 'ts' outputs the jobid.
$ id=$(ts sleep 10) && ts -w $id && ts -c $id | mail -s taskend $USER &
