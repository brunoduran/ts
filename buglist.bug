0	1	sleep	recv() may return ECONNRESET	\nI don't know why. It happened sometimes, when the client didn't send any\nENDJOB message.\nIt should be investigated.\n\nHypothesis:\n- maybe recv() returns ECONNRESET if the other side process has died but not\n  closed()?\n  simple tests seem to show that it's not true.
