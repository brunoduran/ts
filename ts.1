.TH TS 1 2007-03 "Task Spooler 0.3"
.SH NAME
ts \- task spooler. A simple unix batch system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ts [" actions "] [" options "] [" command... ]
.sp
Actions:
.BI "[\-KCLhV]
.BI "[\-t ["id ]]
.BI "[\-c ["id ]]
.BI "[\-p ["id ]]
.BI "[\-o ["id ]]
.BI "[\-s ["id ]]
.BI "[\-r ["id ]]
.BI "[\-w ["id ]]
.BI "[\-u ["id ]]
.BI "[\-U <"id - id >]
.sp
Options:
.BI "[\-nfgm]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ts
will run by default a per user unix task queue. The user can add commands to
the queue, watch that queue at any moment, and look at the task results
(actually, standard output and exit error).
.SH SIMPLE USE
Calling
.B ts
with a command will add that command to the queue, and calling it without
commands or parameters will show the task list.
.SH COMMAND OPTIONS
When adding a job to ts, we can specify how it will be run and how will the
results be collected:
.TP
.B "\-n"
Don't store the standard output/error in a file at
.B $TMPDIR
- let it use the
file descriptors decided by the calling process. If it is not used, the
.B jobid
for the new task will be outputed to stdout.
.TP
.B "\-g"
Pass the output through gzip (only if
.B \-n
). Note that the output files will not
have a .gz extension.
.TP
.B "\-f"
Don't put the task into background. Wait the queue and the command run without
getting detached of the terminal. The exit code will be that of the command, and
if used together with \-n, no result will be stored in the queue.
.TP
.B "\-m"
Mail the results of the command (output and exit code) to
.B $TS_MAILTO
, or to the
.B $USER
using
.B /usr/sbin/sendmail.
Look at
.B ENVIRONMENT.
.SH ACTIONS
Instead of giving a new command, we can use the parameters for other purposes:
.TP
.B "\-K"
Kill the
.B ts
server for the calling client. This will remove the unix socket and
all the
.B ts
processes related to the queue. This will not kill the command being
run at that time.
.TP
.B "\-C"
Clear the results of finished jobs from the queue.
.TP
.B "\-l"
Show the list of jobs - to be run, running and finished - for the current queue.
This is the default behaviour if
.B ts
is called without options.
.TP
.B "\-t [id]"
Run the system's tail to the output file of the named job, or the last
running/run if not specified.
.TP
.B "\-c [id]"
Run the system's cat to the output file of the named job, or the last
running/run if not specified.
.TP
.B "\-p [id]"
Show the pid of the named job, or the last running/run if not specified.
.TP
.B "\-o [id]"
Show the output file name of the named job, or the last running/run 
if not specified.
.TP
.B "\-s [id]"
Show the job state of the named job, or the last in the queue.
.TP
.B "\-r [id]"
Remove the named job, or the last in the queue.
.TP
.B "\-w [id]"
Wait for the named job, or for the last in the queue.
.TP
.B "\-u [id]"
Make the named job (or the last in the queue) urgent - this means that it goes
forward in the queue so it can run as soon as possible.
.TP
.B "\-U <id-id>"
Interchange the queue positions of the named jobs (separated by a hyphen and no
spaces).
.TP
.B "\-h"
Show help on standard output.
.TP
.B "\-V"
Show the program version.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B "TS_MAXFINISHED"
Limit the number of job results (finished tasks) you want in the queue. Use this
option if you're tired of
.B \-C.
.TP
.B "TS_ONFINISH"
If the variable exists pointing to an executable, it will be run after the
queued jobs. It uses execlp, so
.B PATH
is used if there are no slashes in the variable content.
.TP
.B "TMPDIR"
As the program output and the unix socket are thought to be stored in a
temporary directory, 
.B TMPDIR
will be used if defined, or
.B /tmp
otherwise.
.TP
.B "TS_SOCKET"
Each queue has a related unix socket. You can specify the socket path with this
environment variable. This way, you can have a queue for your heavy disk
operations, another for heavy use of ram., and have a simple script/alias
wrapper over ts for those special queues. If it's not specified, it will be
.B $TMPDIR/socket-ts.$USER.
.TP
.B "TS_MAILTO"
Send the letters with job results to the address specified in this variable.
Otherwise, they're sent to
.B USER.
The system
.B /usr/sbin/sendmail
is used. The
job outputs are not sent as an attachment, so understand the consequences if you
use the
.B \-gm
flags together.
.TP
.B "USER"
As seen above, it's used for the socket name if
.B TS_SOCKET
is not defined, and
also as the mail destination if
.B TS_MAILTO
is not specified.
.SH BUGS
If you want to run complex commands, you may want to run them through
.B sh -c 'commands...'
Also, remember that stdin/stdout/stderr will be detached, so
don't use your shell's redirection operators when you put a job into background.

Now, if an internal problem is found in runtime, a file
.B /tmp/ts.error
is created, which you can submit to the developer in order to fix the bug.

.SH NOTES
This page describes
.B ts
as in version 0.3. Other versions my differ. The file
.B TRICKS
found in the distribution package can show some ideas on special uses of
.B ts.
